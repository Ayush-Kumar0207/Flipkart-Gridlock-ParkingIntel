## 🎯 Problem Statement

*How can AI-driven parking intelligence detect illegal parking hotspots and quantify their impact on traffic flow to enable targeted enforcement?*

On-street illegal parking and spillover parking near commercial areas, metro stations, and events choke carriageways and intersections. Enforcement is patrol-based and reactive. There is no heatmap of parking violations vs. congestion impact, making it difficult to prioritize enforcement zones.

## 💡 Our Solution

SignalFlow transforms **298,450 real parking violation records** from Bengaluru into actionable intelligence through a 5-stage AI pipeline — from raw data to an interactive, decision-support dashboard.

## 📸 Dashboard Preview

### 🗺️ View 1 — Hotspot Map

HDBSCAN-detected violation clusters overlaid on a dark Leaflet map with a subtle density backdrop. The default Priority Lens keeps the judge view clean, while Audit All mode exposes the full cluster set for verification. The bottom time-slider animates violations across a full 24-hour cycle.

![Hotspot Map — 674 clusters detected across Bengaluru with a clean Priority Lens and operations brief](assets/hotspot_map.png)

### ⏱️ Time Animation (24-Hour Cycle)

Press play to watch violation patterns shift throughout the day. Notice how hotspots intensify during morning rush hours (8–11 AM IST) and dissolve during afternoon lulls — enabling time-aware enforcement scheduling.

### 📊 View 2 — Analytics Dashboard

8 interactive Chart.js visualizations revealing temporal patterns, vehicle-type distributions, violation breakdowns, and enforcement zone rankings — all derived from 298K real records.

### 🚔 View 3 — AI Patrol Planner

AI-optimized enforcement recommendations powered by our reliability-adjusted **Congestion Impact Score (CIS)**. The patrol budget simulator compares 5, 10, 15, and 20-unit deployments, redraws the deployment route on the map, and adds a deployment frontier so reviewers can see marginal weekly gain as patrol capacity increases. The current priority action is Upparpet during 08:00–11:00 IST with 5 units, backed by high-volume repeat demand and a rising trend.

### 📈 View 4 — Violation Forecasts

XGBoost-powered 7-day violation forecasting with model validation metrics. Red bars highlight predicted above-average days. Station trend indicators flag zones with increasing violation pressure (↑) requiring proactive attention.

| **📈 Forecasts** | XGBoost-powered 7-day violation forecasting per zone with model validation metrics and station trend indicators. |
| **📋 Operations Brief** | Judge-facing decision layer: best first action, city peak window, station playbooks, and 5/10/15/20 unit deployment scenarios. |
| **🎬 Auto Tour** | Built-in guided walkthrough that auto-navigates all 4 views — perfect for live demos and recorded submissions. |

### Novel: Congestion Impact Score (CIS)

```
CIS = raw_score × (0.55 + 0.45 × evidence_confidence)

raw_score = 0.40 × log_violation_density
          + 0.20 × main_road_fraction
          + 0.12 × heavy_vehicle_ratio
          + 0.13 × peak_hour_concentration
          + 0.15 × traffic_window_fraction
```

A weighted composite metric that quantifies how severely each junction/zone's parking violations impact traffic flow. The evidence-confidence adjustment prevents tiny low-sample hotspots from outranking sustained high-impact zones.

### Setup & Run

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Run the data pipeline (processes data + trains models + exports JSON)
python run_pipeline.py
